# nussinov
Python implementation of Nussinov Algorithm with some test comparisons

To run the code, one requires installation of Python 3.6+ along with packages Numpy and Matplotlib.
Download the code file and the tests cases folder. Ensure the test cases file directory is in the correct location. 

The algorithm runs in O(n^3) and may take a while to finish running through all the files within the folder as sequence lengths increase.
